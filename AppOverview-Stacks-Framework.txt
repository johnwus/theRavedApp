## Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Student Verification and Security
**Challenge**: Ensuring only legitimate students can access the app while maintaining data security.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement UITS API integration with secure token-based authentication
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Use HTTPS for all communications and encrypt sensitive data at rest

### 2. Media Storage and Performance
**Challenge**: Handling large media files efficiently without compromising app performance.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement progressive loading and lazy loading techniques
- Use AWS S3 or similar cloud storage with CDN distribution
- Compress images and videos client-side before upload
- Generate optimized thumbnails for media previews
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed content

### 3. Scalability for Growing User Base
**Challenge**: Ensuring the system can handle growing usage as adoption increases.

**Mitigation**:
- Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
- Implement caching layers (Redis, CDN) for frequently accessed data
- Use database indexing and query optimization
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience
- Regular load testing and performance monitoring

### 4. Faculty-Specific Content
**Challenge**: Managing content segregation by faculty while maintaining an engaging experience.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement efficient tagging and metadata systems
- Design flexible content filtering algorithms
- Create balanced feed algorithms that mix faculty-specific and trending content
- Monitor engagement metrics across faculties to refine algorithms

### 5. Monetization Strategy
**Challenge**: Implementing a sustainable voluntary contribution model.

**Mitigation**:
- Develop transparent value proposition for contributions
- Implement seamless, minimal-friction payment processes
- Create tangible benefits for contributors (featured profiles, additional features)
- Monitor engagement and contribution metrics to optimize strategy

- User growth strategies

A store feature where one can make purchases based on outfits posted for selling also, improve the interaction activities by ensuring that every click, hover, focus on a main item leads to some action, the chat also should work well, the page shouldn't be static but dynamic we should be able to load more post using an algorithm that generates random post so everything feels like it is being fetch from a server and interactions should also have some sort of local store for them, moreover the feel of the app should be a mobile first design with all the relevant theming and styling improved the main post button should be on the bottom tabs but a persistent button on the right side corner that on click triggers the create post, the create post interface should be improved to look more like the threads post creation interface

## **Communication Patterns**

### **Synchronous Communication**
```java
// Service-to-service REST calls
@FeignClient(name = "user-service")
public interface UserServiceClient {
    @GetMapping("/users/{userId}")
    UserDTO getUser(@PathVariable String userId);
}
```

### **Asynchronous Communication**
```java
// Kafka for event-driven architecture
@EventListener
public void handlePostCreated(PostCreatedEvent event) {
    // Update feed algorithm
    // Send notifications
    // Update analytics
}
```

### **Real-time Communication**
```java
// WebSocket for live features
@MessageMapping("/chat.send")
public void sendMessage(@Payload ChatMessage message) {
    messagingTemplate.convertAndSend("/topic/room/" + message.getRoomId(), message);
}
```

## **Database Design per Service**

### **User Service Schema**
```sql
users (id, student_id, email, password_hash, faculty_id, created_at)
student_verifications (id, user_id, verification_status, document_url)
faculties (id, name, university_id, created_at)
```

### **Content Service Schema**
```sql
posts (id, user_id, content, media_urls, faculty_id, created_at)
media_files (id, post_id, file_url, file_type, size)
post_tags (id, post_id, tag_name)
```

### **Social Service Schema**
```sql
likes (id, user_id, post_id, created_at)
comments (id, user_id, post_id, content, parent_id, created_at)
follows (id, follower_id, following_id, created_at)
```

## **Deployment Architecture**

### **Container Setup** (Docker + Kubernetes)
```yaml
# Each microservice as separate container
services:
  api-gateway:
    image: raved/api-gateway:latest
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
  
  user-service:
    image: raved/user-service:latest
    ports: ["8081:8081"]
    depends_on: [postgres, redis]
  
  content-service:
    image: raved/content-service:latest
    ports: ["8082:8082"]
    depends_on: [postgres, s3]
```

### **Infrastructure Services**
```yaml
Infrastructure:
  Database: PostgreSQL cluster (read replicas)
  Cache: Redis cluster
  Message Queue: Kafka cluster + RabbitMQ
  File Storage: AWS S3 / MinIO
  Load Balancer: NGINX / AWS ALB
  Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
  Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
```

## **Frontend Service Communication**

### **API Integration**
```typescript
// RTK Query service definitions
export const userApi = createApi({
  reducerPath: 'userApi',
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: 'https://api.raved.com/users',
  }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getProfile: builder.query<User, string>({
      query: (userId) => `/profile/${userId}`,
    }),
  }),
});
```

### **Real-time Integration**
```typescript
// Socket.io client
const socket = io('wss://api.raved.com/chat');

socket.on('new-message', (message) => {
  dispatch(addMessage(message));
});
```

## **Scaling Strategy**

### **Horizontal Scaling Points**
1. **API Gateway** - Multiple instances behind load balancer
2. **User Service** - Scale for authentication load
3. **Content Service** - Scale for media processing
4. **Social Service** - Scale for high interaction volume
5. **Real-time Service** - Scale WebSocket connections

### **Database Scaling**
```sql
-- Read replicas for each service
User Service: Primary + 2 read replicas
Content Service: Primary + 3 read replicas (heavy reads)
Social Service: Primary + 2 read replicas
```

### **Caching Strategy**
```yaml
Redis Clusters:
  Session Cache: User sessions, JWT tokens
  Content Cache: Feed data, popular posts
  Social Cache: Like counts, comment counts
  Real-time Cache: Active chat sessions
```
